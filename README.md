# Home Broadcaster
*Name up for revision*

This application is for hosting your own IPTV service at home. The application takes a list of
video files as an input and will create a continuous stream that runs 24/7.

This project is heavily inspired by deanochips own project found here: https://github.com/deanochips/HLS-XMLTV---Home-Broadcasting

Essentially I have started this project to recreate what deanochips has created but in Python. This
is meant to be a learning experience while also fixing some of the issues I ran into in the original
source code.
